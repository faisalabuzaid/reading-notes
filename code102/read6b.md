# CSS

**CSS** Cascading Style Sheets : it's the look of a web page as the html is the structure.

**in CSS we can manage the spaces between our elements with padding and margins, making borders, changing the color and background color**


### We have 3 types of css depends where we wrote the code :

1. Inlince CSS : the code whould be within the same element tag for example : ``` <h1 style="color:red;"> HEAD1 </h1> ``` .

2. Internal CSS : The code would be withing a specific tag in the same of html page for example if we want to nake h1 color red as the prev example ``` <style type=text/css> h1 { color:red; } </style> ```

3. External CSS : The code will be in a different page with css extension and we put a code inside the html to relate them together with ``` <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="./style.css"> </link>```
