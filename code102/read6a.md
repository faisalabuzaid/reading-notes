# Functions

Function is a series of statments and instruction can be defined and called whenever we need it.


## Function Declarations

### A declared function is “saved for later use”, and will be executed later, when it is invoked (called).

for example ``` function example () {```
 ```   return 5;```
``` } ```

## Function Expression

### A function expression can be stored in a variable:

For xample ``` var x = function (a, b) {return a * b}; ```

After a function expression has been stored in a variable, the variable can be used as a function. Functions stored in variables do not need function names. They are always invoked (called) using the variable name.
