# What Is Node and When Should I Use It?

Node.js® is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome’s V8 JavaScript engine.

The V8 engine is the open-source JavaScript engine that runs in Google Chrome and other Chromium-based web browsers, including Brave, Opera, and Vivaldi. It was designed with performance in mind and is responsible for compiling JavaScript directly to native machine code that your computer can execute.

## “Hello, World!” the Node.js Way

You can check that Node is installed on your system by opening a terminal and typing node -v. If all has gone well, you should see something like v12.14.1 displayed. This is the current LTS version at the time of writing.

Next, create a new file hello.js and copy in the following code:
`console.log("Hello, World!");`

## Support for Modern JavaScript

We can install packages 

- Locally for example `npm init -y`

- Globally for example `npm install -g jshint`
