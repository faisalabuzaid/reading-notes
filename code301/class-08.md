# SQL 

SQL, or Structured Query Language, is a language designed to allow both technical and non-technical users query, manipulate, and transform data from a relational database. And due to its simplicity, SQL databases provide safe and scalable storage for millions of websites and mobile applications.

**Relational databases**

relational database represents a collection of related (two-dimensional) tables. Each of the tables are similar to an Excel spreadsheet, with a fixed number of named columns (the attributes or properties of the table) and any number of rows of data.

- Select Queries : `SELECT column, another_column, â€¦`
`FROM mytable;`

*The result of this query will be a two-dimensional set of rows and columns, effectively a copy of the table, but only with the columns that we requested.*
