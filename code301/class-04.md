# Links

**Defintion** 

Links are the defining feature of the web because they allow you to move from one web page to another.

**Types of links**

- Links from one website to another (absolute urls)
- Links from one page to another on the same website(relative urls)
- Links from one part of a web page to another part of the
same page
- Links that open in a new browser window
- Links that start up your email program and address a new
email to someone

**Writing a link**

Links are created using the `<a>` element. Users can click on anything
between the opening `<a>` tag and the closing `</a>` tag. You specify
which page you want to link to using the href attribute.
Writing Links
`<a href="http://www.mywebsite.com">`Mywebsite`</a>`
This is the page the link takes you to Opening link tag This is the text the user clicks on Closing link tag.

# Layout

**Defintion**

Layout is where each element sits on a page.

**Key Concepts in Positioning Elements**

1. Building Blocks : CSS treats each HTML element as if it is in its
own box. This box will either be a block-level
box or an inline box. ![blocks](https://media.gcflearnfree.org/content/5e82363212da9215e057b928_03_30_2020/block_vs_inline_diagram.png)
    - block-level box : start in a new line, for exapmle `h1 p `and `ul`.
    - inline box: flow in between surrounding text, for example `img i`

2. Containing Elements: 
If one block-level element sits inside another
block-level element then the outer box is
known as the containing or parent element.

3. Controll ing the
Position of El ements.


</br>

- `<div>` elements are often used as containing elements
to group together sections of a page.
- Browsers display pages in normal flow unless you
specify relative, absolute, or fixed positioning.
- The float property moves content to the left or right
of the page and can be used to create multi-column
layouts. (Floated items require a defined width.)
- Pages can be fixed width or liquid (stretchy) layouts.
- Designers keep pages within 960-1000 pixels wide,
and indicate what the site is about within the top 600
pixels (to demonstrate its relevance without scrolling).
- Grids help create professional and flexible designs.
- CSS Frameworks provide rules for common tasks.
- You can include multiple CSS files in one page.

# Function methods and objects

- Functions allow you to group a set of related
statements together that represent a single task.
- Functions can take parameters (informatiorJ required
to do their job) and may return a value.
- An object is a series of variables and functions that
represent something from the world around you.
