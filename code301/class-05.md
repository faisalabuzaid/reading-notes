# IMAGE 
The \<img> tag is used to insert images in the HTML documents. It is an empty element and contains attributes only. 

Each image must carry at least two attributes:
  the src attribute, and an alt attribute.

You can use the width and height attributes to specify the width and height of your image. You can find your image's width and height in a number of ways. For example on the Mac you can use Cmd + I to get the info display up for the image file. Returning to our example, we could do this: 

     <img src="images/dinosaur.jpg" alt="The head and torso of a dinosaur skeleton; it has a large head with long sharp teeth" width="400"  height="341">

# Color 

Every color on a computer screen is created by mixing amounts of red,
green, and blue. To find the color you want, you can use a color picker.


HTML color codes are hexadecimal triplets representing the colors red, green, and blue (#RRGGBB). For example, in the color red, the color code is #FF0000, which is '255' red, '0' green, and '0' blue. These color codes can change the color of the background, text, and tables on a web page.

# Text

HTML contains several elements for defining text with a special meaning.

There are properties to control the choice of font, size,
weight, style, and spacing.

X There is a limited choice of fonts that you can assume
most people will have installed.

# Typeface Terminology\

Typeface :

 - Serif: Serif fonts have extra details on the ends of the main strokes of the letters. These details are known as serifs.

 - Sans-Serif:sans-serif fonts have straight ends to letters, and therefore have a much cleaner design.

 - Monospace:every letter in a monospace (or fixed-width) font is the same width. (Non-monospace fontshave different widths.)

    When choosing a typeface, it is important to understand that a browser will usually only display it if it's installed on that user's computer
    
    
    
    
Bold font-weight
