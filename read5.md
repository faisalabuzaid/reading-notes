# Operators and Loops

## Comparision Operators

**Comparision operators** are operators to compare two values to each other and the result should be True or False, Operators examples ``` == : equal to, != : not equal to, === : strict equal to ``` etc

**Logical Operators** are operators to test more than one condition,
- && result will be two true if both conditions are true only.
- || result will be true if one of the two conditions is true.
- ! this will invert the result of the conditon.

## Loops

A loop will check a condition and do the code block inside it and repeat it until the condition become false

### Types of Loops

1. For Loop: for run the code a specifin number of times
2. While Loop: if you don't know how many times the code should run
3. Do While Loop: Same as while but it will run the code at least once even if the condition is false
