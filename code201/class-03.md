## HTML Lists

- There are lots of occasions when we
need to use lists `<li> </li>`. HTML provides us with
three different types:
    1. Ordered lists are lists where each item in the list is numbered. For example, the list might be a set of steps for a recipe that must be performed in order, or a legal contract where each point needs to be identified by a section
number. `<ol> </ol>`


    2. Unordered lists are lists that begin with a bullet point (rather than characters that indicate order) `<ul> </ul>`.


    3. Definition lists are made up of a set of terms along with the definitions for each of those terms`<dl> </dl>`.


- Lists can be nested inside one another.


## BOXES    

We mean by boxes that css deals with each HTML element as it lives in its own box.

- You can use CSS to control the dimensions of a box.
- You can also control the borders, margin and padding
for each box with CSS.
- It is possible to hide elements using the display and
visibility properties.
- Block-level boxes can be made into inline boxes, and
inline boxes made into block-level boxes.
- Legibility can be improved by controlling the width of
boxes containing text and the leading.
- CSS3 has introduced the ability to create image
borders and rounded borders.

## Arrays in JS

An array is a special type of variable. It doesn't
just store one value; it stores a list of values.

## SWITCH STATMENT

A switch statement starts with a
variable called the switch value.
Each case indicates a possible
value for this variable and the
code that should run if the
variable matches that value.

- You have a default option that is run if
none of the cases match.
- If a match is found, that code is run; then
the break statement stops the rest of
the switch statement running (providing
better performance than multiple i f
statements).
