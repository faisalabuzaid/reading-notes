# Stacks and Queues

## What is a Stack
A stack is a data structure that consists of Nodes. Each Node references the next Node in the stack, but does not reference its previous.

**FILO**

First In Last Out

This means that the first item added in the stack will be the last item popped out of the stack.

**LIFO**

Last In First Out

This means that the last item added to the stack will be the first item popped out of the stack

## What is a Queue

**Common terminology for a queue is**

1. Enqueue - Nodes or items that are added to the queue.
2. Dequeue - Nodes or items that are removed from the  queue. If called when the queue is empty an exception will be raised.
3. Front - This is the front/first Node of the queue.
4. Rear - This is the rear/last Node of the queue.
5. Peek - When you peek you will view the value of the front Node in the queue. If called when the queue is empty an exception will be raised.
6. IsEmpty - returns true when queue is empty otherwise returns false.


***Queues follow these concepts:***

**FIFO**
First In First Out

This means that the first item in the queue will be the first item out of the queue.

**LILO**
Last In Last Out

This means that the last item in the queue will be the last item out of the queue.
