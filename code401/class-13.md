### How to run Linear regression in Python scikit-Learn:

- Scikit-learn is a powerful Python module for machine learning.
- It contains function for regression, classification, clustering, model selection and dimensionality reduction.
- Important functions of a linear regression model are:
- 1 - lm.fit() -> fits a linear model
- 2 - lm.predict() -> Predict Y using the linear model with estimated coefficients
- 3 - lm.score() -> Returns the coefficient of determination (R^2). A measure of how well observed outcomes are replicated by the model, as the proportion of total variation of outcomes explained by the model.

### Types of Linear Regression:


1. Simple linear regression: 1 dependent variable (interval or ratio), 1 independent variable (interval or ratio or dichotomous)
2. Multiple linear regression: 1 dependent variable (interval or ratio) , 2+ independent variables (interval or ratio or dichotomous)
3. Logistic regression: 1 dependent variable (dichotomous), 2+ independent variable(s) (interval or ratio or dichotomous)
4. Ordinal regression: 1 dependent variable (ordinal), 1+ independent variable(s) (nominal or dichotomous)
5. Multinomial regression: 1 dependent variable (nominal), 1+ independent variable(s) (interval or ratio or dichotomous)
6. Discriminant analysis:1 dependent variable (nominal), 1+ independent variable(s) (interval or ratio)
