## Dynamic Routes

Defining routes by using predefined paths is not always enough for complex applications. In Next. js you can add brackets to a page ( [param] ) to create a dynamic route (a.k.a. url slugs, pretty urls, and others).

**Page Path Depends on External Data**

## Next.js deployment

The easiest way to deploy Next. js to production is to use the Vercel platform from the creators of Next. js. Vercel is a cloud platform for static sites, hybrid apps, and Serverless Functions.
