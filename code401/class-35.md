# Implementation: Graphs 

## Graphs

 - A graph is a non-linear data structure that can be looked at as a collection of vertices (or nodes) potentially connected by line segments named edges.
 - Vertex - A vertex, also called a “node”, is a data object that can have zero or more adjacent vertices.
 - Edge - An edge is a connection between two nodes.
 - Neighbor - The neighbors of a node are its adjacent nodes, i.e., are connected via an edge.
 - Degree - The degree of a vertex is the number of edges connected to that vertex.
 
## Directed vs Undirected

- **Undirected Graphs**:
  - An Undirected Graph is a graph where each edge is undirected or bi-directional. This means that the undirected graph does not move in any direction.

  
- **Directed Graphs (Digraph)**:
  - A Directed Graph also called a Digraph is a graph where every edge is directed.
  - Unlike an undirected graph, a Digraph has direction. Each node is directed at another node with a specific requirement of what node should be referenced next. 
  

  
## Complete vs Connected vs Disconnected

  - **Complete Graphs**: A complete graph is when all nodes are connected to all other nodes.

  - **Connected**: A connected graph is graph that has all of vertices/nodes have at least one edge.

  - **Disconnected**: A disconnected graph is a graph where some vertices may not have edges.

## Acyclic vs Cyclic

  - **Acyclic Graph**: An acyclic graph is a directed graph without cycles. A cycle is when a node can be traversed through and potentially end up back at itself.
  - A directed acyclic graph is also called a DAG. This can also be represented as what we know as a tree.

  - **Cyclic Graphs**: A Cyclic graph is a graph that has cycles.A cycle is defined as a path of a positive length that starts and ends at the same vertex.

## Graph Representation

  - 1 - Adjacency Matrix
  - 2 - Adjacency List
  
 - **Adjacency Matrix**: An Adjacency matrix is represented through a 2-dimensional array. If there are n vertices, then we are looking at an n x n Boolean matrix.Each Row and column represents each vertex of the data structure. The elements of both the column and the row must add up to 1 if there is an edge that connects the two, or zero if there isn’t a connection.

- **Adjacency List**:An adjacency list is the most common way to represent graphs. An adjacency list is a collection of linked lists or array that lists all of the other vertices that are connected.Adjacency lists make it easy to view if one vertices connects to another.

## Weighted Graphs
  - A weighted graph is a graph with numbers assigned to its edges. These numbers are called weights.
  - When representing a weighted graph in a matrix, you set the element in the 2D array to represent the actual weight between the two paths.
  - If there is not a connection between the two vertices, you can put a 0, although it is known for some people to put the infinity sign instead.

  - Within adjacency lists, you must include both the weight and the name of the adjacent vertex.
