# Data Visualization
## Matplotlib tutorial:

matplotlib is probably the single most used Python package for 2D-graphics.

It provides both a very quick way to visualize data from Python and publication-quality figures in many formats.

**IPython and the pylab mode:**
1. IPython is an enhanced interactive Python shell that has lots of interesting features including named inputs and outputs, access to shell commands, improved debugging and much more.
2. When we start it with the command line argument -pylab (--pylab since IPython version 0.12), it allows interactive matplotlib sessions that have Matlab/Mathematica-like functionality.

**pyplot:**
1. pyplot provides a convenient interface to the matplotlib object-oriented plotting library.
2. It is modeled closely after Matlab(TM). Therefore, the majority of plotting commands in pyplot have Matlab(TM) analogs with similar arguments.
3. Important commands are explained with interactive examples.
