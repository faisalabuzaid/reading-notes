## The Best Whiteboard Interview Advice I Ever Received

  - **What Do You Mean Communicate?**
    - Let’s say you are in the interview and your interviewers throw you a whiteboard question. 
    - Do you step up to the whiteboard and feverishly start solving the problem? No!
    - Do you understand what they’re asking you to do? Prove it. Restate the question for them and seek affirmation. 
    
  - **Ask About Edge Cases**
    - It’s still not time to dive right into coding the solution.
    - Think for a bit about the inputs and expected output and think about potential edge cases to the problem. Ask about them.
    - In many cases, the interviewer hasn’t even thought about edge cases and will make something up. 
    
  - **Ask About Test Cases**
    - This is free and you should take advantage of it. 
    - Simply ask if there are any test cases that the function should pass. 
    - Your interviewer might be expecting you to ask this question, so it might be necessary. 
    - But it’s also possible the interviewer was not expecting the question and will think “ah, this candidate knows about testing!”
    
  - **Write Pseudocode and Ask If It Makes Sense**
    - In the best case, the interviewer might actually point out logical flaws in your pseudocode that will give you some serious benefit when transitioning to actual code.
    
  - **Write the Actual Code and Ask if it Looks Good**
    - You should now convert your pseudocode into actual code.
    - You don’t even need to remove the comments. At this point, you just need to plug the appropriate code for your language in.
    - If you forget some syntax or a method name, you should be able to ask your interviewer for this information without too much grief.
    - If they give you trouble, just say you’ll leave it as pseudocode for now.
    
  - **Stuck? Ask for Help!**
    - If you’re having trouble along the way, it’s not illegal to ask for some help. Just phrase it conversationally.

## 6 tips to ace a programming interview

  - 1) Take a few minutes
    - Shut your eyes, stare at the ceiling, scribble on the whiteboard — whatever it takes. 
    - Think through the basics of the problem, and decide on an approach.
    - Then re-engage the interviewer, and let him know what you’ve concluded. Don’t forget to provide your reasoning!
  - 2) Write down the steps of the solution.
    - Write down the general steps of how you will solve it on one side of the whiteboard, where it’s visible but won’t get in the way. 
    - You don’t need to be verbose, just get the steps in order and somewhat readable.
    
  - 3) Write pseudocode first.
    -  write some half-baked code-looking stuff that lays out the structure of how your code will work.
    - Do it over on the side of the whiteboard, so you have space left to work.
    
  - 4) Don’t sweat the small stuff.
    - don’t waste time memorizing keywords in your interview prep. 
    - Focus on the big picture.
    
  - 5) Sit down. Be humble.
    - A programming interview isn’t just a written exam. 
    - It’s an assessment of your programming abilities, and there are plenty of things that fall into that category beyond mere coding prowess
    
  - 6) Come prepared.
    - If you want to be ready, you have to put in the time.
    - It’s important in order to maximize your chances of acing the interview, but it’s also important for your peace of mind during the interview and afterwards.
    - In the interview, knowing that you’ve done all you can to prepare helps you stay calm and cool, and increases your chances of success.
    - And afterwards, regardless of the outcome, knowing that you could not have reasonably done more to prepare helps you feel proud of your work and start moving towards your next goal.
